      <h2>What is Self-Advocacy?</h2>
      <p>If you are living with a mental health condition, there might be times when you feel like decisions are being made on your behalf and without your input. However, it is your right to be involved in any decisions made about you, including your treatment, the services you access and your living arrangements. Self-advocacy is when you speak up about what you need or want.</p>

      <h2>Self-Advocacy Worksheet</h2>
      <p class="info">Standing up for yourself can be difficult, especially if you’re not used to doing it. You might think that you don’t have the skills to speak up for yourself, or you won’t be taken seriously. Sometimes it can help to write down what needs to be done so that you have a plan to follow. Below is a template that can be filled in and printed, which can help you to brainstorm some ideas to achieve what you want.</p>
