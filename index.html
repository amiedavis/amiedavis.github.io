        <h4>What is Self-Advocacy?</h4>
        <p>
          If you are living with a mental health condition, there might be times when you feel like decisions are being
          made on your behalf and without your input. However, it is your right to be involved in any decisions made
          about you, including (but not limited to) your medical treatment, the services you access and your living
          arrangements. Self-advocacy is when you speak up about what you want or need, to ensure that you are able to
          live the life you want.
        </p>
        <h4>Overcoming Barriers</h4>
        <p class="info">
          Standing up for yourself can be difficult, especially if you’re not used to doing it. You might think that you
          don’t have the confidence to speak up for yourself, or you won’t be taken seriously. Some other barriers
          people face are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Not knowing what your rights are;</li>
          <li>Lacking the skills or resources that are required to fix a problem; or</li>
          <li>Being too unwell to express your wishes or needs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Knowing Your Rights</h5>
        <p class="info">
          Knowing your rights can help you to recognise when you are not being treated appropriately and stand up for
          yourself. For example, in Australia, treatment options available for your mental health condition must be
          explained to you so that you can make an informed decision about your own recovery. Even if you are receiving
          involuntary treatment, you have a right to have your treatment explained to you and for your wishes to be
          taken into account. For more information, refer to the Mental Health Act plain language guides for each
          Australian state and territory in the <a href="#resources-anchor">Resources</a> section below.
        </p>
        <h5>Getting Support</h5>
        <p>
          Sometimes, we simply can’t solve a problem on our own. Asking for help is a sign of strength and is a
          proactive way to take control in your recovery. There are many sources of help, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Family and friends</li>
          <li>Community mental health teams</li>
          <li>Psychologists/Social workers</li>
          <li>Your GP</li>
          <li>Financial advisors</li>
          <li>Legal Aid</li>
          <li>Community organisations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can even ask for help from the person or organisation you need to stand up to. For example, if you
          received a late fee for a phone bill that you were unable to pay due to being unwell, you may find that a
          simple call to the phone company to explain your situation is enough to have your fee waived.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don’t know where to go for support, there are organisations in each state and territory that
          specifically help people with advocacy issues. Refer to the
          <a href="#resources-anchor">Resources</a> section for a list of some organisations in Australia.
        </p>
        <h5>Creating an Advance Care Plan</h5>
        <p>
          It is possible to document your treatment preferences and/or nominate someone to make decisions on your behalf
          in times when you are unwell. This document is called an Advance Care Plan and is a good idea for everyone,
          not just those with a chronic illness. Information on how to write a plan and the different requirements
          across Australia can be found on the
          <a href="https://www.advancecareplanning.org.au/#/" target="_blank">Advance Care Planning Australia</a>
          website.

        <h4>Self-Advocacy Worksheet</h4>

            Advocating for yourself can feel like a daunting task. Below is a template that can be filled in and
            printed, with prompting questions to help you brainstorm what you want to change and how you might go about
